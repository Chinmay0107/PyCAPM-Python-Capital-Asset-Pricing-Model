# PyCAPM-Python-Capital-Asset-Pricing-Model
**Overview**
This project implements the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to analyze the relationship between the returns of a specific stock and the returns of the market. The CAPM helps calculate the expected return of an asset based on its beta (a measure of its volatility relative to the market) and the risk-free rate.

**Features**
Download historical stock data using yfinance
Calculate monthly logarithmic returns
Compute the stock's beta using covariance matrix and linear regression methods
Calculate the expected return of the stock based on the CAPM formula
Visualize the relationship between market returns and stock returns with a regression line
